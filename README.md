# multi-purpose-discord-bot
the discord bot ive been working on for fun its kinda neat


# important:
this bot runs off discord.js, jikanjs and some other dependencies that arnt in this repo like ytdl core and ffmpeg.
so if you just snag the index file expecting it to work you need to npm install all the dependencies in the bot folder
